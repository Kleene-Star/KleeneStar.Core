# KleeneStar.Core - The Modular Backbone

**KleeneStar.Core** is the foundational module of the **KleeneStar** platform. It defines the architecture, plugin interfaces, and system conventions that power modular knowledge, process, and asset management.

Built on the **WebExpress-Framework**, it provides the runtime logic, lifecycle hooks, and extensibility patterns that enable distributed, privacy-conscious applications.

## What It Powers

**KleeneStar.Core** orchestrates the modularity behind **KleeneStar**. It connects plugins, manages context, and ensures consistent behavior across the platform.

Every feature is a plugin. The core defines shared types, routing logic, and event dispatching. It is designed for composition, override, and reuse. The codebase is minimal and scalable, ready for distributed deployments.

## For Developers

This repository is the starting point for building plugins, extending platform behavior, or contributing to KleeneStar itself.
It includes core logic in C#, plugin base classes, system interfaces, and an event bus. Architecture documentation and example plugins help you get started quickly.
