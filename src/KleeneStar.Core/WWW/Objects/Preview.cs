    /// The page is the sibling of <see cref="Detail"/> and bridges the same mismatch: the
    /// Kanban boards and the scrum backlog report the object <em>id</em> in their selection
    /// event, while the reduced view
    /// (<see cref="global::KleeneStar.Core.WWW.Issue._objectkey_.Preview"/>) — like every
    /// per-kind route — is keyed by the object <em>key</em>. Which of the two bridges a
    /// master-detail points its uri template at is therefore the whole choice between the
    /// full reading view and the pane-sized one.
    ///
    /// The boards and the backlog point here, at the same view their list siblings already
    /// show. A detail frame embeds a page's main content region, and that region of the full
    /// reading view is written for a full-width column: beside a board it arrives without the
    /// property column that carries the status and the people — that lives in
    /// <c>#wx-content-property</c>, a sibling of the region the frame takes — while the
    /// inline-editable field card, the description editor, the attachment list and the
    /// comment thread are squeezed into the pane. The reduced view is the opposite selection,
    /// and it carries a button that opens the full one.
    ///
    /// <see cref="Detail"/> stays for the callers that mean a navigation rather than a pane,
    /// such as the schedule entries.
    ///
    /// The page is deliberately outside every navigation scope: it is not a destination a
    /// user browses to, but the endpoint the detail frame fetches for the selected card.
