    /// The page exists to bridge one mismatch. The detail routes of the object kinds
    /// (<c>/issue/{objectkey}</c>, …) are keyed by the object <em>key</em>, while a board or
    /// a backlog reports the object <em>id</em> in its selection event, and a schedule entry
    /// carries an id as well - so neither can address the reading view directly. They point
    /// at this page instead, and it forwards to the real one.
    ///
    /// A redirect rather than a rendered summary, because the target is meant to show the
    /// object itself. A frame fetches its uri with the default redirect handling, so it
    /// follows the forward transparently and embeds the view it lands on.
    ///
    /// The target is the full reading view. Every master-detail pane takes the reduced
    /// <see cref="global::KleeneStar.Core.WWW.Issue._objectkey_.Preview"/> instead, through
    /// the sibling <see cref="Preview"/> bridge - the boards and the backlog as much as the
    /// lists, because what makes the reading view the wrong pane content is not the width of
    /// the pane but that a frame embeds a page's main content region alone. What is left for
    /// this page is the caller that means a navigation rather than a pane: a click on a
    /// schedule entry opens the object.
    ///
    /// The page is deliberately outside every navigation scope: it is not a destination a
    /// user browses to, but the endpoint a caller resolves an id through.
