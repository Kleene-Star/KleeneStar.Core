/**
 * KleeneStar: opens a comment composer on the WYSIWYG form instead of on its one-line trigger.
 *
 * The framework's ControlDataCommentComposer always mounts collapsed: it paints a single-line
 * button ("Write a comment…") and only builds the category picker, the rich-text editor and the
 * send button once that button is clicked or focused. There is no server-side option and no data
 * attribute to start expanded, so a page that wants the form to be there cannot say so — see the
 * remedy note in CommentComposerExpandScript.
 *
 * A composer opts in by carrying the ks-comment-composer-open class, which the fragment authoring
 * it declares. This expands exactly those, once each:
 *
 *     <div class="wx-webapp-comment-composer ks-comment-composer-open" …>
 *
 * The expansion goes through the composer's own trigger rather than through its internals, so it
 * uses the same path a user's click takes and keeps working when the control's private fields are
 * renamed. What has to be undone afterwards is the focus: expanding focuses the editor, which on
 * page load would scroll straight past the issue to the form at the bottom of it. The focus is
 * therefore taken back and the scroll position restored, before the browser paints — so the reader
 * arrives at the top of the issue, with the form already open below it.
 *
 * "Once each" is deliberate: a reader who closes the form with Cancel has said they do not want
 * it, and re-opening it under them would be the opposite of a convenience.
